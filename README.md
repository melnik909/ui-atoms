# ui-atoms

## Why I use prefixes such as ra-, uia-, etc
I want to separate atoms by meaning that it would be cleaner and developers could understand what an atom's purpose is. I separated atoms into the following groups:
* ra-* — atoms reset default styles
* uia-* — atoms that are used for creating UI elements
* ha-* — atoms are helpers
