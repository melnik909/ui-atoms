# ui-atoms

## What's the repository about?
This repository is my knowledge store. All my development process will be saved here. I develop reusable components and docs that help me don't repeat things that are made. 

## What a atom is

## Why I use prefixes such as ra-, uia-, etc
I want to separate atoms by meaning that it would be cleaner and developers could understand what an atom's purpose is. I separated atoms into the following groups:
* ra-* — atoms reset default styles
* uia-* — atoms that are used for creating UI elements
* ha-* — atoms are helpers
